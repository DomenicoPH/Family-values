                    <p class="block__parr"><span class="parr-start-letter">F</span>rom the distant reaches of the cosmos, where stars burn bright and the void hums with mysteries untold, came a family of extraterrestrials from the planet Xombur. The Xomburian sky, tinged with hues of amethyst and gold, had long been their home, a place where love, prosperity, and health thrived under the benevolent gaze of twin suns. But the Xomburian society was curious and adventurous, always seeking new frontiers to explore. Thus, the family of Drax, comprised of Zol, Mira, their children Kael and Lora, and the wise elder, Arkan, embarked on a journey to a small blue planet known to its inhabitants as Earth.</p>
                    <br class="block__space">
                    <p class="block__parr">Their arrival was a spectacle of brilliance and wonder. The family descended in a shimmering craft that tore through the Earth's atmosphere like a comet, landing in a secluded forest far from human eyes. Yet, what awaited them was a cruel twist of fate. The Earth’s atmosphere, rich in oxygen and teeming with microorganisms foreign to Xomburian biology, triggered a dreadful mutation. Their once radiant forms began to wither and decay, their vibrant blue skin turning a ghastly shade of gray-green, and their organs deteriorating with alarming speed.</p>

            <div class="block">

                <div class="block__text">
                    <p class="block__parr"><span class="parr-start-letter">Z</span>ol, the father, watched in horror as his family transformed into something monstrous. Mira's luminous eyes dulled, Kael’s agile limbs stiffened, and Lora’s melodic voice became a guttural groan. Arkan, with centuries of wisdom, knew that their fate was sealed but sought to comfort them with tales of Xombur, where the stars would remember their names.</p>
                    <br class="block__space">
                    <p class="block__parr">Love, which had been their guiding star, became a distant memory. Zol and Mira, who once shared an unbreakable bond, found their affections eroded by the relentless decay of their bodies. The touch that once brought comfort now only reminded them of their shared torment. In their rotting hearts, they mourned the loss of their vibrant past but clung to the hope that their unity as a family might see them through.</p>
                    <br class="block__space">
                    <p class="block__parr">As time wore on, the family of Drax adapted to their ghastly new existence. They roamed the Earth’s forests, avoiding human settlements and surviving on what little sustenance their corrupted forms could tolerate. Their spaceship, once a symbol of hope and exploration, became a makeshift home and a constant reminder of what they had lost.</p>

                    <p class="block__parr"><span class="parr-start-letter">Y</span>ears turned into decades, and the legend of the Xomburian zombies spread among local human communities. Sightings of decaying figures wandering the woods fueled tales of haunted forests and cursed lands. Yet, despite their horrifying appearance, the family of Drax remained fiercely protective of each other. They faced countless challenges—harsh winters, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of human discovery—but their bond as a family held firm.</p>
                    <br class="block__space">
                    <p class="block__parr">Generations passed, and the children of Kael and Lora, born into this cursed existence, knew nothing of the world beyond their forest. They were taught the stories of Xombur, of its beauty and prosperity, and the values of unity and resilience. The elder Arkan, now a venerable figure with most of his body long decomposed, became the keeper of their history, ensuring that the spirit of Xombur lived on in the hearts of his descendants.</p>

                    <p class="block__parr"><span class="parr-start-letter">T</span>hrough their trials, the family of Drax discovered an unyielding strength within themselves. Love, though altered, was not entirely lost. It manifested in small acts of care—tending to each other's wounds, sharing the sparse food they could find, and comforting one another during the darkest nights. Money, a concept foreign to their new existence, was of no concern. Their wealth lay in the memories of Xombur and the lessons passed down through generations.</p>
                    <br class="block__space">
                    <p class="block__parr">Health, in its traditional sense, was unattainable. Their bodies, forever decayed and rotten, could never be healed. Yet, they found solace in the endurance of their spirits. The family of Drax refused to succumb to despair, choosing instead to find purpose in their unity. They became guardians of their forest home, protecting it from human encroachment and preserving its natural beauty.</p>

                    <p class="block__parr"><span class="parr-start-letter">T</span>he humans, though fearful of the legends, never fully understood the true nature of the Xomburian zombies. Occasionally, a brave soul would venture into the forest, seeking to uncover the truth behind the myths. These encounters often ended in terror, but the family of Drax never harmed the intruders. They knew too well the pain of loss and sought only to protect their sanctuary.</p>
                    <br class="block__space">
                    <p class="block__parr">In the twilight of his existence, Arkan gathered the family for one final tale. His voice, though weak, carried the weight of their shared history. He spoke of the twin suns of Xombur, of the vibrant cities and the boundless skies. He reminded them of their ancestors' courage and the importance of their unity. As his final breath left his decayed lungs, Arkan’s spirit became one with the forest, his essence forever intertwined with the land he had come to love.</p>

They honored Arkan's memory by passing down his stories and teachings to their children. The forest, their eternal home, became a place of reverence and memory, where the spirit of Xombur thrived despite the decay of their bodies.</p>
                    <br class="block__space">
                    <p class="block__parr">Through the endless cycles of decay and renewal, the family of Drax remained steadfast. Their legacy, though born of tragedy, was one of resilience and unbreakable bonds. In the heart of the forest, among the whispering trees and hidden glades, the spirit of Xombur lived on. The family, though cursed and mutated, found a strange kind of peace in their unity. They proved that even in the face of unimaginable adversity, the strength of a family could prevail, undiminished by the ravages of time and the harshness of fate.</p>
